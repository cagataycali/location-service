# Location Service :zap:

You're planning to build a location-based application. You are looking for the best practical solution. There's your realtime solution.

# Why I did these?

I try to build location based app like as everybody. Location based apps make sense. I look for IaaS for my little project. But surprisingly it did not exist. I decided to do it. Service will remain free and open forever.

# Roadmap

- Documentation Improvements (v.1.1.0)
- Email template (v.1.2.0)
- Benchmarking (v.1.3.0)
- GraphQL Endpoint (v.1.4.0)
- Ruby, Go, Python, C# Clients (v.1.5.0)

# Issues

- There is nothing about documentation, landing page, logo, email template etc. Maybe who has killer design skills can be done this job. Because if I do, it will look like a [:shit:](https://location-service.cagatay.me).
- If is there any SQL wizard who wants to contribute open source, may help improve my shitty nearby solution. *Clik shit!* [:shit:](https://github.com/cagataycali/location-service/blob/master/lib/sequelize.js#L145)
